This is an ecommerce app built for the comp433 web services project.

The app is written by the group members Ting Liu, Jianshi Yuan, and Jung-ju(Sonia) Lin.

The purpose of the app, as required for the project, is an ecommerce app that has a product inventory that enables different services depending on the user type. Specifically, the app would be playing the role of the platform Amazon, which enables its partners to add and manage products, and its customers to order products listed either by Amazon or partners.

-- comp433p2_UML.pdf diagram which outlines the domain model and the capacity of the app for later services exposure
-- An app that has the basic architecture laid out per the above two mentioned diagrams
